    - Welcome to Panama, where you will explore both the Darien of the past, and
      the Darien of the present.
    - Sigvald Linne was a swedish archaeologist who traveled through South and Central
      America in 1929, documenting existing life and searching for historical artifacts.
    - You are presently assisting ecological anthropologist Lucy Gill, as she builds
      relationships and documents local flora and fauna, while following past descriptions
      to archaeological findings in the Darienacts.
    - You are beginning in Punta Patino, and will start by re-reading Linne's text
      again, and following environmental landmarks to search for Linne's findings.
      Good luck!
