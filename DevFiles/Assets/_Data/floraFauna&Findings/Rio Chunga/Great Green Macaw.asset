    - Description / Info: The Great Green Macaw
    is one of the largest macaws in the world (second only to the Hyacinth Macaw).
    It''s also known as the Buffon''s or Great Military Macaw and in fact was previously
    considered a subspecies of the smaller, closely-related Military Macaw.

    -
    Numbers of this majestic macaw have dropped by more than 50 percent over the
    past 10 years due to extensive habitat loss throughout the species'' Central
    and South American range. It was listed as an endangered species by the United
    States in 2015.

    - Unsustainable logging, conversion of land for agriculture
    and cattle pasture, and mining have severely diminished available habitat for
    the Great Green Macaw. Unfortunately, farmers sometimes shoot the birds, believing
    that they are a crop pest. The birds are also captured for the pet trade and
    for their feathers
