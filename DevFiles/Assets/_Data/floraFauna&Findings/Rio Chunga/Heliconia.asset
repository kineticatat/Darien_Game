  Description: 'Heliconia leaves are characteristically long and oblong, often forming
    large clumps with age. Their flowers are produced on long, erect or drooping
    panicles, and consist of brightly colored, waxy bracts, with small true flowers
    peeping out from the bracts. They also look like lobster claws. The growth habit
    of heliconias is similar to Canna, Strelitzia, and bananas, to which they are
    related. The flowers can be hues of reds, oranges, yellows, and greens, and are
    subtended by brightly colored bracts. Floral shape often limits pollination to
    a subset of the hummingbirds in the region. '
