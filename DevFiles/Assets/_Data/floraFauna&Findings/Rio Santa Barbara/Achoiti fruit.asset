  Description: '- Bixa orellana

    - Fruits of an achiote shrub are heart-shaped,
    brown or reddish brown at maturity, and are covered with short stiff hairs. Achiote
    dye is prepared by stirring the seeds in water and can be used to color butter,
    cheese, rice and other foods. Women of the Embera would add a bit of red color
    on their faces with the natural dye of achiote or to dye fibers for their craft.
    Red was often extracted from the achiote berry, which was boiled with the fiber.
