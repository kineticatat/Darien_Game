  m_Name: Tagua Nut
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  name: 
  Description: The tagua is a nut. It grows on a tree and is found in a grape-like
    cluster. Each shell yields a a few nuts two to three inch long. These nuts when
    dried become very hard and can be carved. The outer layer is brown, but the inside
    nut is white and after polishing takes on the hue of ivory. The work on tagua
    nuts is very recent, but carvers have mastered it and produce incredibly delicate
    and intricate animal figures. Some are painted with bright chemical paints which
    often detracts from the carved details of the work. True enthusiasts will appreciate
    the quality of the work on unpainted pieces.
