  Description: "  -Genipa Americana\r\n  -Juice used as tattoo / body paint (ebony
    color)\r\r\n  -The jagua is an inedible fruit which the Waounan and Embera people
    have long used as a body dye. The fruit is hard and needs to be grated. The pulp
    is then mixed with a very small amount of water and squeezed by hand or inside
    a piece of fabric to extract a liquid that darkens as it oxidizes. To make it
    stronger, the liquid is often heated in a pan over a fire to make it more viscous.
    Then the jagua juice is ready to be applied directly on dry skin. It dries in
    minutes and the indelible markings cannot be removed with any type of soap, detergent
    or chemicals. It remains in the skin until the upper layer of skin is naturally
    exfoliated by the body. \r\n"
