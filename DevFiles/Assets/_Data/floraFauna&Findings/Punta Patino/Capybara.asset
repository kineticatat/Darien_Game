  Description: '- Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris

    - Description / Info: Capybara,
    (genus Hydrochoerus), also called carpincho or water hog, either of two species
    of large semiaquatic South American rodents. Capybaras inhabit forests and wetlands
    from Panama to Argentina. The larger of the two species, the capybara (Hydrochoerus
    hydrochaeris), is the largest living rodent in the world, growing up to about
    1.3 metres (4.3 feet) long and weighing up to 79 kg (174 pounds). The lesser
    capybara (H. isthmius) is smaller, growing to about 1 metre (about 3 feet) in
    length and weighing about 28 kg (62 pounds). Some classifications list capybaras
    as the only members of family Hydrochoeridae, whereas others place them within
    the subfamily Hydrochoerinae of the family Caviidae. Capybaras resemble the cavy
    and the guinea pig.
